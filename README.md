**Hey there! üëã I'm David.**

I'm a software developer from Spain. With a degree in Electronic Engineering, I've transitioned my career into web development. I enjoy all the possibilities that it brings and the immediacy of the web platform. What I mostly enjoy about software development is being immersed in a problem, be it a feature implementation or a pesky bug, trying to find that perfect solution. I also thoroughly enjoy refactoring; there is something beautiful about grabbing some messy code and turning it into a coherent and perfectly decoupled, magical work of art (or, you know, a bit less messy).

For the last 18 months I have been working on Rango. A cross-browser extension that is helping hundreds of people with mobility challenges navigate the web and use their browsers with ease.

Here is what some people have to say about Rango:

- ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê Thank you for developing this! Super, super convenient with Talon compared to Click by Voice/Vimium/other options. ‚Äî Zachary McGohan
- ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê Really great work. Only problem is it makes you wish this functionality was built in to everything and not just the browser! Super useful. ‚Äî John Arnold
- ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê Really love this - Definitely a crucial addition to Talon and to hands-less computer interaction. ‚Äî Jon Weinrib
- ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê This is the only extension that is faster then the vimium chrome extension to interact with websites using pure voice and talon. ‚Äî Sandeep Joel

### Other Open Source Contributions

While not the main creator, I am the main contributor of this vscode extension. Similar to (and inspired by) Rango this vscode extension helps people with mobility issues navigate the files and folders of a vscode workspace using their voice.

#### [Talon Community](https://github.com/talonhub/community)

I have also made some contributions to Talon Community, the de facto standard user file set for the [Talon](https://talonvoice.com/) software for hands-free computer use.

I realized early that one can quickly become overwhelmed if they just try to learn everything. So I have taken the approach of learning technologies/skills as I need them.

- **TypeScript**: This is where I spend most of my time. I feel fairly confident writing TypeScript and I'm always trying to improve.
- **React**: I'm not so experienced here but I have used it to some extent and I want to keep improving on it. The Rango setting page is built entirely using React. I write modern React using function components with hooks instead of class based components.
- **HTML & CSS**: In the process of building Rango I became quite proficient with the DOM and CSSOM. I can say I am a stacking context master üòÄ. Although I enjoy more working on the backend of the frontend I'm currently working on gaining proficiency in these two technologies to become a more well rounded web developer.
- **Jest**: Testing allows me to make changes with confidence and Jest has been my choice for writing test for Rango.
- **Puppeteer**: I have used Puppeteer extensively to write tests for Rango.
- **Python**: I have some experience with Python. Mostly in the context of writing scripts for Talon.
- **Git**: I use git and GitHub almost every day. I have also written some GitHub actions to test Rango on every push and pull request.
- **npm**: Another indispensable tool for me.

#### Currently Learning

I'm currently trying to level up my frontend development skills. I am working through the Frontend Mentor Challenges. You can take a look at my solutions [here](https://github.com/david-tejada/frontendmentor-challenges).

#### My Languages

- üá™üá∏ **Spanish**: Native.
- üá∫üá∏ **English**: Fluent/proficient spoken and written.
- üá©üá™ **German**: Advanced intermediate / conversational.
- üá´üá∑ **French**: Lower intermediate.
